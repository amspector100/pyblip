==================================
Welcome to pyblip's documentation!
==================================

``pyblip`` is a python implementation of BLiP (Bayesian Linear Programming), a method to jointly localize and detect signals. Given nearly any Bayesian model, ``pyblip`` is designed so that BLiP can wrap on top of the Bayesian model in only one or two lines of code to enhance its power. See [usage](amspector100.github.io/pyblip/usage.html) for more tutorials!
