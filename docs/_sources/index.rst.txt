==================================
Welcome to pyblip's documentation!
==================================

``pyblip`` is a python implementation of BLiP (Bayesian Linear Programming), a method to jointly localize and detect signals. Given nearly any Bayesian model, ``pyblip`` is designed so that BLiP can wrap on top of the Bayesian model in only one or two lines of code to enhance its power. Check out the Tutorials section for more examples!
